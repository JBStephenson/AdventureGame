1 Introduction
This document will describe the file format which is used to define the behavior of the Adventure game. It will be an ongoing and updated document. The file defines the following items with examples:
        1. Rooms
        2. Players
XML is used as the basis for the definition file. All of the data needed to start a game, or to save a game, will be stored in the XML file.


2 General Consideration
Each item must have a name, with the exception of the player, as a unique identifier. The name must only be unique in its’ given category. 


Players will gain points by entering rooms. Once a room is visited its’ points will be set to zero so the player can no longer gain points by visiting the room.
